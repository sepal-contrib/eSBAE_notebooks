    "1. Forest area and deforestation statistics according to Global Forest Change product ([Hansen et al 2013](https://10.1126/science.1244693))\n",

    "\n",
    "The E-SBAE notebooks are a series of Jupyter notebooks intended to streamline the process of creating activity data for measurement, reporting, and verification of REDD+ and other carbon standards. \n",
    "\n",
    "E-SBAE is mainly based on the sampling-handler python library that provides all the necessary underlying functionality. While the notebooks take away the heavy burden of coding each single element, you will only need to declare some basic input variables that define your custom needs. This means you **do not need** to be a an experienced python programmer, but a basic understanding does help.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that the structure of each notebook is fairly similar, with only the parameter settings adapting for the current step. You can also use individual parts for specific purposes, but going through each of the notebooks consecutively ensures the best way for a smooth execution of the entire process.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two elements that tie the outputs of each notebook together - the ***Project Name*** and an underlying ***configuration file***. This not only eases the interaction but also ensures transparency, reproducibility, and interaction between different steps/notebooks. "
