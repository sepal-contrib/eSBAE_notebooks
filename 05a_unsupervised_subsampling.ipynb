    "\n",
    "This notebook takes you through the process of clustering your data points in an unsupervised fashion. From this you can select a subsample, which can serve as a basis for annotation. Data is exported as a CEO compatible file. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why we use KMeans over a simple random selection is that we want to overproportoinally capture rare classes. For example, one of the clusters does represent change events, but the cluster itself consists of only 1% of all samples. In a random selection of 100 points, only 1 point would be selected. If we choose 10 clusters  adn sample 10 points within each cluster, we assure that 10% of the samples are actually change. This is beneficial for subsequqnt steps of classifying, as we need a sufficient amount of samples for our rare classes of change. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of clusters is an iterative approach. The Statistic Plots will help to see, if any cluster actually might capture forest change pre-dominantly. The number of points per cluster are determined by th eoverall amount of samples one is able to later interpret. "
