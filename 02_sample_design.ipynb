    "### Creation of point samples for subsequent time-series extraction and analysis\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The base for the eSBAE approach is a dense grid that captures change at a sufficient level of confidence. A systematic sampling design shall be be employed. This notebook provides the functionality to create such a grid over the given AOI (defined in Notebook 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "Two grid shapes are available, i.e. squared or hexagonal grid. In addition, it is necessary to determine the size of each grid cell as well as the projection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Squared grid**\n",
    "\n",
    "Squared grids are a simple way of creating a grid. They are in use for various geospatial applications. The grid size of the squared grid is selected in metres, defining the single border length of each grid cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Hexagonal grid**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lately, hexagonal grids are adapted in National Forest Monitoring Sytems as they possess some particular characteristics. Foremost, they reduce the error on area, but they also do assure that each point within the grid cell is mre or less at the same distance to the centre. Indeed, the ideal shape under that criteria would be a circle. It is however not possible to create a consistent grid of circles. The hexagon is the shape of polygon that comes closest to this criteria, while being able to provide a consistent grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook provides a simplified interface to the dggrid software library from [Southern Oregon University](https://www.discreteglobalgrids.org/software/). \n",
    "DGGRID holds code to generetate standardized hexagonal grids based on a *Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS)*  with a set of predefined resolutions for specific projections optimized for equal area.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand that DGGRID has a **fixed set of resolutions** that should be selected from column *res* in the below table (You need to check the manual for other resolutions if you select a different projection than the ISEA3H)\n",
    "\n",
    "For advanced usage it is recommended to consult the [manual](https://webpages.sou.edu/~sahrk/docs/dggridManualV70.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](images/dggrid_isea3h_ap3_res_table.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Sampling strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook allows to select from 2 sampling strategies within each grid cell, *centroid* and *random*. The centroid will take the centre point according to the projection selected, while the random option \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ***Projections***\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating samples, an important consideration is the projection used. Projections always exhibit distortions with regard to the actual sphere-like shape of the Earth. As our aim is to give each sample the same weight in terms of area representativeness, we shall select a projection that is optimised for **equal area**. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Squared grid projections**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the table below you can find some examples of global equal area projections to select from. The information is taken from an article from Yildrim & Kaya 2008 and can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3790990/#:~:text=The%20level%20of%20distortion%20can,compared%20to%20equal%2Darea%20maps). **Note** that the commonly used Lat/Lon projection (EPSG:4326) **does** contain distortions that shall be avoided.\n",

    "3. Grid projection (as epsg/esri code): As described above, projection is an important part when creating the grid. However, equal area projections are not the most commonly used projections. The routine is able to use a different grid system internally for creating the grid and/or placing the centroid. Note that when having selected a hexagonal grid, this projection is only being used for the placement of the centroid.\n",
    "4. Output projection: this will define the projection of the final output file, independent of the projection the grid was defined. For this, it can also be a projection that is not ideal for the creation of sampling grids such as Lat/Long.\n"
